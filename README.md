#Code Every Day Challenge

To begin with I will be going through [this Haskell](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) course.

##Rules

Here are my rules (which I stole from GreyHoodies/CodeEveryDay. Thanks :) ) :

- Must write code every day. I can write slides,tutorials, docs or anything else, as long as it is in addition to the code That I write.
- Code must be useful, no tweaking indentation, code reformatting or re-factoring counts towards the tally.
- Days end at Midnight
- Code must be Open Source and pushed to github, as this is going to be the means of tracking that I did it everyday. I want my github to look like this.
- University Assignments and paid work - don't count towards my tally (unless it is open source and on github)
