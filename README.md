#Code Every Day Challenge

To begin with I will be going through [this Haskell](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) course.

##Rules

Here are my rules (which I stole from GreyHoodies/CodeEveryDay. Thanks :) ) :

- Must write code every day. I can write slides,tutorials, docs or anything else, as long as it is in addition to the code That I write.
- Code must be useful, no tweaking indentation, code reformatting or re-factoring counts towards the tally.
- Days end at Midnight
- Code must be Open Source and pushed to github, as this is going to be the means of tracking that I did it everyday. I want my github to look like this.
- University Assignments and paid work - don't count towards my tally (unless it is open source and on github)


###Day 02

Instead of Haskell today, I went back to Clojure and did some
[koans](https://github.com/Lanzafame/clojure-koans). 

###Day 03

So a hiccup. Spent most of Day 03 in a hospital waiting room with my wife. I actually spent most of my time trying to figure out how to compose a DMux gate from AND, OR, and NOT gates for project 1 of the [nand2tetris](https://github.com/Lanzafame/nand2tetris/tree/master/projects/01) course.
